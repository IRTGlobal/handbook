One of the values that we hold most important is what we refer to as the Culture of The Commons. 
Our mission statements in the Culture of the Commons are simple and will be explained further below. 

Collaborate but be decisive 
A rising tide lifts all boats 

Collaborate but be decisive

Everyone here has a voice.  You and your fellow colleagues are all here because we believe that you all have a valuable contribution to make to our company, our projects, our clients, vendors, and profits.   

Working together, especially in a distributed culture like ours takes commitment to foster a culture of mutual respect for your fellow humans.  We expect that you treat others in the ways you would want to be treated and we consider it our own obligation to remind each other of the same. 

Collaboration means that we work together, but it does not mean that all decisions are made by committee. Groupthink can be dangerous.  You will find we make good use of the “RACI” matrix here, where the “A” for each decision is the ultimate decisionmaker.  We collaborate but, in the end, we are clear about decision-making responsibility. 

Very important is your commitment to “disagree but commit”.  To disagree but commit means that, while you may not agree with a decision, you commit to executing on that plan with one hundred percent of your efforts.  Far too many good decisions die because of the indifference of those tasks with bringing those decisions to life.  We will not allow our decisions to suffer the same fate.  Someday it will be your decision that other disagree with; you will of course value their ability to commit while not necessarily agreeing with your decision. 
A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats 

We believe that we should always seek solutions that benefit all, as the tide that lifts us up lifts them as well. In practice this means feeling free to share things of value with our customers and our vendors.  

For example, with our vendors we typically work them to improve process, get them SA8000 certified, etc. These actions provide benefits not just for us but for all of the customers of those vendors.

Simply put, we give away ninety percent of our efforts to contribute to the greater good, while making our living from the ten percent that represents what we are best in the world at.
